# LINQ Examples and Enhancements in .NET 9

## 📚 Description

Welcome to the **LINQ Examples and Enhancements in .NET 9** project! This repository showcases a series of **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)** examples, demonstrating its powerful features in C#. It includes a range of queries — from basic to advanced — to help developers understand and master LINQ operations.

This project highlights the following:

- **Basic LINQ operations** (e.g., `Select`, `Where`, `OrderBy`)
- **Advanced LINQ techniques** like `GroupBy`, `Join`, and `SelectMany`
- **New LINQ methods** introduced in **.NET 9**, including `Index`, `CountBy`, and `AggregateBy`

Whether you are just starting with LINQ or looking to explore new features in .NET 9, this repository has something for everyone!

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The project is divided into three main categories to cater to different skill levels:

### 1. **Easy LINQ Queries**
   - Simple queries to get started with LINQ operations.
   - Ideal for beginners.

### 2. **Medium LINQ Queries**
   - Advanced LINQ operations including grouping, sorting, and combining multiple collections.
   - Suitable for developers with some experience.

### 3. **Advanced LINQ Queries**
   - Complex examples leveraging new features like `Index`, `CountBy`, and `AggregateBy`.
   - Includes scenarios that require working with nested objects and real-world data structures.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Common LINQ operations**: Examples like `Select`, `Where`, `OrderBy`, etc.
- **Advanced techniques**: Learn how to use `GroupBy`, `Join`, `SelectMany`, and more.
